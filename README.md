# Password_Generator
The password generator website is a simple tool 
that allows users to generate strong and secure 
passwords. By selecting various options such as 
password length and including special characters, 
numbers, or uppercase letters, the website 
generates a random password that meets the 
user's criteria. This project aims to provide users 
with a convenient and reliable solution for creating 
unique and robust passwords, enhancing their 
online security and privacy using html,css and 
javascript.
